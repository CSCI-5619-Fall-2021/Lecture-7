# Lecture 7: Interaction and Physics

Detailed explanation of this code can be found in the lecture video (will be added after class).

## Topics

1. How to use the action-based XR rig
2. Rapid development using the XR Device Simulator
3. Grabbing objects with the controllers
4. Physics and colliders
5. Demonstration of the [XR Interaction Toolkit Examples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples)

## Participation Exercise

Download [WorldInteractionDemo.apk](https://canvas.umn.edu/files/23311033/download?download_frd=1) from Canvas and install the file on your Oculus Quest using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/).  Spend a few minutes experimenting with the interactions at each of the various stations.  Note that some of the higher complexity models in the scene cause judder due to dropped frames.  You can observe this while looking at an object and slowly moving your controllers across your view.  

To get participation credit, submit a screenshot of the view inside the headset while performing some interesting action.  You can use SideQuest to stream the headset view to your computer, as demonstrated in class.
